			<p>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and
			 white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming
			 underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.s</p>
